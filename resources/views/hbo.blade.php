      <!--About motivation-->

        <h4>What is motivation?</h4>

        <h4>
          Motivation can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
        </h4>

        <h4 class="hbo ind">
          According to the Journal of Economic Pscyology, intrinsic motivation
          can simply be defined as motivation without money. Therefore,
          extrinsic motivation is described as motivation purely driven by the
          incentive of money(Kuvaas, 2017). These different types of motivation
          are said to dictate the performance or qaulity of work an individual
          can produce.
        </h4>

        <p class="hbo ind">
          I'm motivated to perform at the best my abilities when it comes to my
          education for a variety of reason. I'm the first person in my family
          to enroll into a university and get the full college experience. This
          is a great honor. Studying in Netherlands during the start of my
          highschool career, was an amazing experience, and since then, it has
          been a dream of mine to attend university in the Netherlands.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind">
          Being able to return and get a higher level of education is something
          I'll always be thankful for. I want to obtain a degree overseas as it
          would likely open up a lot of doors for me in the future and allow me
          to choose a wider range of countries to reside in when I apply for an
          occupation.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind" style="padding-bottom: 30px">
          Like many of the students in the ICT program, I have been fascinated
          with technology at a young age, more specifically with computers and
          how the internet of things works at its most basic level. It's
          commonly known that if you enjoy what you're studying, you're more
          than likely to perform better than if you are studying things you do
          not enjoy. I think this is a more passive motivator, but I find it's
          also one of the most imporant when it comes to academia.

          Am I suitable for the HBO-ICT Program ?

        <img
          class="hbo"
          style="max-width: 30%"
          src="https://recruitshop.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/prepared-businessman1-1030x685.jpg"
        />

        <p class="hbo ind">
          In terms of qaulifications, I have obtained a highschool diploma as
          well as an International Baccalaureate diploma which makes me an
          admissible canidate into the HBO-ICT program.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind">
          Personality wise, I enjoy working in teams. I think it's a lot more
          fun to see what a group of people can do when given an assignment
          since everyone will have their own ideas and approaches. I like to
          think that I'm an easily approachable person and I can talk to anyone
          about anything. I also feel added pressure when working in teams
          because I wouldn't want to be considered dead weight.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind" style="padding-bottom: 30px">
          During my four months of quarantine, I had a realization about myself
          that I never really noticed until I no longer had school work to do. I
          realized i'm enthusiastic about learning and keeping my mind up to
          speed. So, being able to find my program and the approach used to
          provide me with me an education appealing, I believe is important to
          doing well because while assignments and projects might be
          challenging, I'll find myself having a good time working through those
          challenges.
