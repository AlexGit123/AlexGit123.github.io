    <!--About motivation-->

    <div style="text-align: center">
        <h4>What is motivation?</h4>

        <h4>
            Motivation can be categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
        </h4>

        <h4 class="hbo ind">
            According to the Journal of Economic Psychology, intrinsic motivation
            can simply be defined as motivation without money. Therefore,
            extrinsic motivation is described as motivation purely driven by the
            incentive of money(Kuvaas, 2017). These different types of motivation
            are said to dictate the performance or quality of work an individual
            can produce.
        </h4>

        <p class="hbo ind">
            I'm motivated to perform at the best my abilities when it comes to my
            education for a variety of reason. I'm the first person in my family
            to enroll into a university and get the full college experience. This
            is a great honor. Studying in Netherlands during the start of my
            highschool career, was an amazing experience, and since then, it has
            been a dream of mine to attend university in the Netherlands.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind">
            Being able to return and get a higher level of education is something
            I'll always be thankful for. I want to obtain a degree overseas as it
            would likely open up a lot of doors for me in the future and allow me
            to choose a wider range of countries to reside in when I apply for an
            occupation.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind" style="padding-bottom: 30px">
            Like many of the students in the ICT program, I have been fascinated
            with technology at a young age, more specifically with computers and
            how the internet of things works at its most basic level. It's
            commonly known that if you enjoy what you're studying, you're more
            than likely to perform better than if you are studying things you do
            not enjoy. I think this is a more passive motivator, but I find it's
            also one of the most important when it comes to academia.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 10px">
            Am I suitable for the HBO-ICT Program ?
        </h2>

        <img
            class="hbo"
            style="max-width: 30%"
            src="https://recruitshop.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/prepared-businessman1-1030x685.jpg"
        />

        <p class="hbo ind">
            In terms of qualifications, I have obtained a highschool diploma as
            well as an International Baccalaureate diploma which makes me an
            admissible candidate into the HBO-ICT program.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind">
            Personality wise, I enjoy working in teams. I think it's a lot more
            fun to see what a group of people can do when given an assignment
            since everyone will have their own ideas and approaches. I like to
            think that I'm an easily approachable person and I can talk to anyone
            about anything. I also feel added pressure when working in teams
            because I wouldn't want to be considered dead weight.
        </p>

        <p class="hbo ind" style="padding-bottom: 30px">
            During my four months of quarantine, I had a realization about myself
            that I never really noticed until I no longer had school work to do. I
            realized i'm enthusiastic about learning and keeping my mind up to
            speed. So, being able to find my program and the approach used to
            provide me with me an education appealing, I believe is important to
            doing well because while assignments and projects might be
            challenging, I'll find myself having a good time working through those
            challenges.
